What has been done by D.A. and A.Y.:
```
SST issues:https://github.com/mdolab/adflow/issues/285
SST related bugs fixed:https://github.com/DavidAnderegg/adflow/pull/12
SST primary updates:https://github.com/mdolab/adflow/pull/331
SST latest version:https://github.com/DavidAnderegg/adflow/tree/SST_new
https://github.com/DavidAnderegg/adflow/tree/SST2003_LM2009
Note: SST_new branch has some bugs when compiling (it seems that some files have not been properly updated, and they should be fixed later), so I use SST2003_LM2009 branch.
